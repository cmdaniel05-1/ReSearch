## 1. Iteration 2 - Summary

Sarah: I implemented faculty viewing and approving/rejecting references and applications. I implemented faculty seeing the list of students who applied and their profile and application. I improved the UI across all pages. 
Connor: I implemented the ability for student users to be able to view the applications they have applied to in a separate page, updating the progress of the application and the recommendation when they occur. I also made small adjustments to the application model to work better for the recommendation labelling functionality. Finally, I deployed the web app on AWS.<br>
Ian: I set up the application model, and set up the ability for students to apply to positions. I also fixed the things we missed in iteration1, those being the ability to remove research fields and programming languages, and stopping faculty and students from accessing pages they shouldn’t be able to.<br>
April: I implemented faculty seeing only their list of applications in the index rather than every application.<br>

As a faculty member, I want to see the list of students who apply to undergraduate research opportunities I create -  Sarah/April<br>
As a faculty member, I want to view the profiles of students who apply for my research positions so that I may review their qualifications - Sarah<br>
Restrict students from using faculty pages and vice versa - Ian<br>
Add the ability to remove fields and languages. - Ian<br>

## 2. Iteration 2 - Sprint Retrospective

Iteration 2 went pretty well for us, although we did implement a number of features from iteration 3 as well. The AWS instance was challenging but came together. We don’t need any additional changes as a result of iteration 2. 

----
## 3. Product Backlog refinement

We implemented accepting/rejecting references and database tests as part of iteration 2 instead of iteration 3. We also added accepting/rejecting applications and withdrawing pending applications.

## 4. Iteration 3 - Sprint Backlog

As a faculty member or student, I want to login with either my WPI email or using Single Sign-On - April, Ian <br>
Our application needs selenium tests for five functionalities not including registration and login - Sarah <br>
We need one more javascript functionality (sort/filter on index page) - Connor <br>
